radio is a simple programme allowing the user to listen to radio stations. 
Information about the station is stored in a simple configuration file.

'Simple' implies that the application is easy to use, add new stations and
places low (simple) demands on hardware. 


Installation & Requirements
===========================
Requirements
As this is a Bash applcation, it will run on operating system where Bash is running. 

The ffmpeg package must be installed before you can use radio: https://www.ffmpeg.org/
There should be a package of ffmpeg available for your distro, although recent
releases of Debian seems to have (temproarily?) removed ffmpeg. 

Installation
Place the radio Bash in a directory that is listed in your PATH environment
variable (e.g., /usr/local/bin; or $HOME/bin), ensure that execute permissions
have been appropriatly set (chmod u+x reaio) 

Using
=====
To get help:
        radio -h

There are two modes of operation:
        ---graphical user interface
        ---command line 

Simply entering radio without any options will start the GUI. Select a station
with the mouse and the station should begin playing.

Supplying options on the command line will ewnter command line mode (except for
the -g option).  To select a station, use the -s option.


Configuration
=============
Configure stations.  Use the configuration file supplied with this Readme as a
starting template and add your own radio stations.  

The configuration file is named .radio and is first looked for in the current
directory, if not present, then $HOME/.radio is used.

A line begining with a '#' is treated a a comment and ignored.
Each line consist of three columns seperated by a ';'.
The first column is a tag which is supplied to the -s to start the station.  The
second column is a tag displayed in the GUI.  The thir column is the stream
address of the radio station.

Example $HOME/.radio
bbc1;BBC1;http://bbcmedia.ic.llnwd.net/stream/bbcmedia_radio1_mf_p?s=1424601331&e=1424615731&h=e3b4297ec84e3aebe958b1787359dcff

To listen to BBC1, 
    radio -s bbc1
